# FAQ
Q: How can I use a different resolution? It automatically applies previous resolution setting.

A: Delete the config file at `%userprofile%/Documents/BetterValorant/config.txt` or you can edit the file directly.

Q: My Anti-Virus blocks BetterValorant.exe! This is a virus!

A: No, it's just a false-positive. But if you got the exe from somewhere else but here, it might be containing a virus. You can compile the code by yourself so you won't get any viruses.
